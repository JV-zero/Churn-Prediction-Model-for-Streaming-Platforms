# Churn Prediction Model for a Streaming Platform

## Project Overview

As part of a coding challenge, I developed a classification model to predict user churn for a streaming platform. Leveraging Python, machine learning techniques, and customer data analysis, the model identifies users likely to cancel subscriptions, enabling proactive measures to mitigate churn rates and enhance user retention strategies.

## Context

You work at a streaming platform where the management is concerned about the high rate of users canceling their subscriptions. They believe it's possible to predict if a user is more likely to leave the platform before it happens, and based on this information, take actions to reduce churn. Your goal is to create a classification model capable of predicting whether a user is more likely to cancel their subscription on the platform or not. For this, the company provided a csv dataset containing data about customer accounts.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is an adaptation of an e-commerce problem available on Kaggle. It contains information about customer accounts on a streaming platform, including features such as age, gender, average rating, number of devices connected, time spent on the platform, and whether the user churned or not.

## Project Structure

1. **Imports and Initial Setup**: Importing necessary libraries and configuring the environment.

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing steps to handle missing values, data types, and outliers.

4. **Modeling - Logistic Regression**: Implementation of a logistic regression model to predict churn.

5. **Model Tuning for Logistic Regression**: Fine-tuning the logistic regression model to improve performance.

6. **Modeling - Random Forest**: Implementation of a random forest classifier as an alternative model.

7. **Tuning Random Forest Classifier**: Optimization of the random forest classifier to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Getting Started

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset provided by the company.

2. Use Python and libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling.

3. Implement logistic regression and random forest classifiers to predict churn.

4. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Visualize results and insights gained from the analysis to inform business decisions.

6. Document each step, explaining the rationale behind choices made and insights obtained.

## Conclusion

By developing and deploying an effective churn prediction model, the streaming platform can anticipate user behavior, implement targeted retention strategies, and ultimately reduce churn rates. This project demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches in addressing business challenges and improving customer satisfaction.
